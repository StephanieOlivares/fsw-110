SELECTING MULTIPLE ELEMENTS

1. What are some of the differences between getElementById and getElementsByClassName?
* id - returns a single element/object from the document. class name (tag name) returns an array-like object.
* id - needs an id to find, class name - needs a class to find
        document.getElementsByTagName("div")

2. What will `.getElementsByClassName` return if there are no elements with the matching class in the document?
Returns an empty array


3. What will `.getElementById` return if there is no element with the matching id in the document?
`null`







MODIFYING AN ELEMENTS TEXT

Selecting an element doesnâ€™t give us a whole lot of power as developers until we can make changes to the selected elements!

One of the most basic things to change about an element could be its text. (Keep in mind, this is only useful for elements that normally contain text, like paragraphs, headers, list items, etc.)

After selecting the element, you have a few options:
    1. innerHTML - can be a security risk, so it's usually best to avoid this
    2. innerText - can be "expensive" (AKA slow)
    3. textContent - best option for changing the text of an element
    
textContent is a DOM object property, which means we can set it equal to something else using the single equal sign (assignment operator).

E.g. if you had a regular JavaScript object:

    var person = {name: "Joe"}

You could change the name property by doing:

    person.name = "Jim"

You can do the same thing with DOM objects:

    var person = document.getElementById("person")
    person.textContent = "Jim"

-OR- if you combined those into one line and didn't save the variable, it looks like this:

    document.getElementById("person").textContent = "Jim"
